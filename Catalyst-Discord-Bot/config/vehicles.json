With its planet-like turning radius and relatively long gearing, the Olga has trouble getting up to speed, as most cars currently in the game have 4 gears and the Olga's gears are fairly long its underpowered engine can cause it to be very sluggish.",

To get into the back seats, players need to lower the front seats (at least one) to get in the back, making this vehicle difficult to flee with when you are being chased or shot at (if you seat in the back). This is also the only vehicle on PC to have a spare wheel attachment (compared to the PS4 version where the Olga 24 has a spare tyre slot in the trunk) which is under the hood. It comes in 3 colors : Dark Blue, Green and Light Grey. It is currently the second best vehicle off-road (M3S truck being the first one with it's low top-speed and high grip). It is also the only drivable vehicle in DayZ to have rust spots on the bodywork (pointing at the steel quality and poor care given by the owners).",
