  "",
  "The Military Research Facilities are covered in `toxic fumes`, this is caused by the lack of maintenance and protection to what was once a government runned operation to make new chemical weapons. There is now a permanent cloud of toxic gas that seeps from the underground bunkers and covers the facilities.",

  "`Tier 5 loot` spawns in these locations, it is `never a guarantee` to be filled with tier 5 loot, especially if a player has looted it quite recently before you. Be sure to keep a sharp eye out for loot that can easily `blend into the surroundings.`",
